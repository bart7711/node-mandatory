    <p>After creating an express server, endpoinds and routing can be created for it.
        A get request example:
    </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        app.get("/", (req,res) => {
            res.send({ message:"Welcome." });
        });
    </code>
</pre>
    <p>
        Instead of "get" other http methods can be used like "post" or "delete".
        "req" and "res" stand for request and response and are variables passed through the function.
        Request is what we revice from the user and contains things like parameters while response is
        what the server should send back. Express doesn't have a deafult setup for what sort of response
        it should send back. Frequently we want the server to send JSON. In order to set it up
        we need to make the app use build in tools for JSON like so.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
        app.use(express.json());
        </code>
    </pre>
    
    <p>
        There are also two ways of passing the parameters on the endpoint. 
        Either as path variables or the queary strings. It can look like this. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        url/variable
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        or like this  
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        url/?page=value1&limit=value2
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        And here is a post example with endpoint with route parameter.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            app.post("user/:userID",(req,res)=>{
                res.send(req.body);
            });
        </code>
    </pre>
    <br>
    <p>
        The paramaters are stored in the param object int the req. They can be accessed like so.
        req.params.(variable name)
    </p>
    <br>
