        Node.js - A crossplatform runtime environment that wraps JavaScript and executes it outside of the browser.
        As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network
        applications.
        Node.js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature.
        Often it is used to build back-end services and API's (Aplication programming interfaces).
