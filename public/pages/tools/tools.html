        Nodemon - is a tool that helps develop node. js based applications by automatically
        restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
        To use nodemon, replace the word node on the command line when executing your script
        with nodemon. It basically is a wraper for node for development that allows for
        hot reload of code.

        cross-env - There is a problem when you set environment variables in node.js. Basically
        it is handled differently based on the system it is running. There is also a difference in how
        windows and POSIX commands utilize environment variables. To solve it, the corss-env
        node.js module makes it so you can have a single command without worrying about setting or
        using the environment variable properly for the platform.
